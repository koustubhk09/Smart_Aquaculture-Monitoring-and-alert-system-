🌊 Smart Aquaculture Monitoring and Alert System

A real-time water quality monitoring system designed to help fish farming and aquaculture. The system uses IoT sensors connected to Arduino/NodeMCU to measure critical water parameters and provide instant alerts.


📌 Features

Monitors pH, Temperature, Turbidity, and TDS continuously.

Real-time alerts when values go beyond safe ranges.

Displays data on a web-based dashboard.

Helps reduce manual monitoring and ensures healthy aquatic conditions.


⚙️ Working 

1. Sensors (pH, Temperature, Turbidity, TDS) send analog signals to Arduino.

2. Arduino code uses WHO water quality ranges to check if parameters are safe.

✅ Inside range → Good water quality (Green)

❌ Outside range → Poor water quality (Red alert)

3. Data is visualized on Dashboard for easy monitoring.


📊 WHO Water Quality Ranges

Parameter	Safe Range	Unit	Meaning

pH	6.5 – 8.5	—	Acidity/Basicity of water

Temperature	25 – 30 °C	°C	Water temperature for aquatic life

Turbidity	< 5 NTU, NTU show how water pure or unpure 

TDS	500 – 1500 ppm,	ppm	Dissolved salts, minerals, impurities


🚀 Technologies Used

Arduino IDE (for coding & uploading)

IoT Sensors (pH, Temperature, Turbidity, TDS)

NodeMCU/Arduino Board

Web Dashboard (for visualization & alerts)


🏆 Outcome

Ensures better monitoring of aquaculture ponds.

Reduces manual work by automation.

Improves water quality management for healthier fish growth.
